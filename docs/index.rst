num_dual - generalized (hyper) dual numbers in python
====================================================

Using dual numbers, you can compute exact derivatives of functions without writing analytical derivatives
or using numeric differentiation.

Installation
------------

You can install `num_dual` from pypi using `pip`:

```
pip install num_dual
```

Build from source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the code from source, you need the `rust compiler <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>`_ and `maturin <https://github.com/PyO3/maturin>`_.
You can then install the latest master directly from github:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/itt-ustutt/num_dual
```
